# SVG Logo Maker

SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## Usage

The user is prompted for text, where he can enter up to three characters.
When the user is prompted for the text color, he can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).
When the user is prompted for a shape, he is presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.
When the user is prompted for the shape's color, he can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).
When the user has entered input for all the prompts, an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` and the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.
When the user opens the `logo.svg` file in a browser, he is shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered.
